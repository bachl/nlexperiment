![nlexperiment](img/logo.png)
Define and run NetLogo experiments in R

## About
[NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) (Wilensky 1999) 
is a multi-agent programmable modeling environment.
[RNetLogo](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RNetLogo/)
package (Thiele 2014) opened countless possibilities
by connecting R with NetLogo.
But it does require some programming in R to define and run
experiments.
The purpose of **nlexperiment** is to make
exploring NetLogo models as simple as possible (like NetLogo 
[Behavior Space](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/behaviorspace.html) tool)
while keeping more complex functionalities as available options.

## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("bergant/nlexperiment")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(nlexperiment)
# Set the path to your NetLogo instalation
nl_netlogo_path("c:/Program Files (x86)/NetLogo 5.1.0/") 
fire_model <- file.path(nl_netlogo_path(), "models/Sample Models/Earth Science/Fire.nlogo")
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r ch1, child="readme_parts/readme1.rmd", cache=TRUE}
```

```{r ch2, child="readme_parts/readme2.rmd", cache=FALSE}
```

```{r ch3, child="readme_parts/readme3.rmd", cache=FALSE}
```

```{r ch4, child="readme_parts/readme4.rmd", cache=FALSE}
```

```{r ch5, child="readme_parts/readme5.rmd", cache=FALSE}
```
