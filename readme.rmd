####Define and run NetLogo experiments in R##

The goal of **nlexperiment** is to make
exploring agent based models in [NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) (Wilensky 1999) as simple as possible (like NetLogo 
[Behavior Space](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/behaviorspace.html) tool)
while keeping complex functionalities available for
advanced users.
It uses [RNetLogo](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RNetLogo/)
package (Thiele 2014) as an interface to NetLogo.

## Installation

`library(devtools)`   
`install_github("bergant/nlexperiment")`


```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(nlexperiment)
# Set the path to your NetLogo instalation
nl_netlogo_path("c:/Program Files (x86)/NetLogo 5.2.0/") 
fire_model <- file.path(nl_netlogo_path(), "models/Sample Models/Earth Science/Fire.nlogo")
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r ch1, child="readme_parts/readme1.rmd", cache=FALSE}
```

```{r ch2, child="readme_parts/readme2.rmd", cache=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
```

```{r ch3, child="readme_parts/readme3.rmd", cache=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
```

```{r ch4, child="readme_parts/readme6.rmd", cache=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
```

```{r ch5, child="readme_parts/readme5.rmd", cache=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
```

```{r ch6, child="readme_parts/readme7.rmd", cache=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
```
